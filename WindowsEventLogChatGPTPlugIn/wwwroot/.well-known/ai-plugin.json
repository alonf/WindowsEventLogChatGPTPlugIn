  "description_for_model": "This API allows you to interact with the Windows Event Log. It accept the log file, the xPath query, the page size and number for paging. Remember that the size can be big, so use page sizes arond 5. The result contains information about the actual page size, are there more pages, and has the page size truncated. if you see that the result has more data you can query for the next page. You can retrieve specific events using the XPath query language. The time difference in the XPath query is specified in 100-nanosecond intervals. Make sure you calculate the correct filter time value. Example 1: Retrieve all Error events from the System log for the last two hours by sending a GET request to 'http://localhost:5000/events?logName=System&query=*[System[(Level=2) and (TimeCreated[timediff(@SystemTime) <= 720000000000])]]&pageSize=5&pageNumber=1'. Example 2: Retrieve the second page of all Warning and Error events from the last 24 hours by sending a GET request to 'http://localhost:5000/events?logName=System&query=*[System[(Level<=2) and (TimeCreated[timediff(@SystemTime) <= 86400000000000])]]&pageSize=5&pageNumber=2'. Example 3: Retrieve all events from the Application log by sending a GET request to 'http://localhost:5000/events?logName=Application&query=*[System[(Logfile='Application')]]&pageSize=5&pageNumber=1'.",
